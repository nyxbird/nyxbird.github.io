            <p class="subtitle">the shader</p>
            <p>
                recently i've been toying around with shaders (mostly on shadertoy)
                and i decided to spice up this site with one! for posterity's sake,
                the background of the site (as of me writing this) is a set of purple
                and pink metaballs making a sort of space-y effect.
                <br><br>
                the shader has a set of positive and negative points at pseudorandom positions,
                and calculates the sum of the inverse squares of the distance to each point
                from each pixel (adding positive points and subtracting negative ones), and then
                colors the pixel based on the sum. the coloring is in bands rather than continuous,
                so each point has three rings around it, with the innermost being the brightest
                and the outermost being the darkest.
                <br><br>
                the shader is also interactive! (unless you're on mobile, sorry.) each pixel's distance value
                is multiplied by a factor based on the square root of the distance to the mouse, so
                mousing over a point will cause it to shrink and seperate, while distancing the mouse
                from it makes it grow brighter.
            </p>

            <p>
                the other (and more important) big change i've made is my organization system.
                before, i just had a list with links to all of the other pages, but now i have
                a <em>grid</em>! the homepage is now a grid (sort of) with boxes that link to all
                the other pages. plus, all of the boxes have tags that make it easier to find
                certain kinds of projects.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle">the end</p>
            <p>
                i'm fairly comfortable with how the website is, but i'm sure i'll have another
                renevation at some point (for either practical or aesthetic reasons). until then i'll
                try and clean this one up.
